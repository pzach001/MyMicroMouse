#MyMicroMouse
This is an ongoing side project of mine where the endgoal is to make a MicroMouse. 

#Current Progress
So far I have finished developing the basic functions needed for the micromouse to run. It currently can't solve a maze due because I haven't touched the algorithms aspect of it yet. It runs similar to how a ruumba run's without a vacuum.

###Parts
Here are the hardware parts I am currently using for my MicroMouse:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ardumoto Motor Driver Shield
3. 4 - Micro Metal Gearmotor HPCB 6V with Extended Motor
4. 4 - Pololu Wheel 32×7mm Pair
5. 4 - Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04


#Sources
Most of my sources have been through the tutorials on the  SparkFun Websites.

#Next Steps
My next task is to dig deeper into the algorithms used in the Micromouse's software.
